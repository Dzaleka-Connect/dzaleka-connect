          The festival aims to promote the talents and cultures of Dzaleka to
          Malawians and people from across the globe, as well as to promote
          Dzaleka itself as a place of unity, peace, coexistence and harmony
          among refugees and Malawian populations. It has a vision to change
          public perception towards refugees and to empower them through arts.
