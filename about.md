Being a refugee is more than just seeking asylum; it also involves a sense of pride and belonging. In response to a large influx of refugees from Africa's Great Lakes region in 1994, Dzaleka Refugee Camp, which had previously been a political prison, was transformed into a refugee camp. The primary countries of origin represented in the camp are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, and Somalia. By bringing refugees and diaspora from all over the world together, we can create Dzaleka's largest global community and shape the future of Malawi. We can do this by sharing our knowledge, business opportunities, and connecting with like-minded individuals. The Dzaleka community has a wealth of experience and expertise to offer, and by coming together, we can support each other and work towards a brighter future.

### Our Community

Dzaleka is more than just a refugee camp; it is a community of talented individuals who have a lot to offer the world. By creating a global online platform, we can share the stories and talents of the people in the Dzaleka community and show the world that refugees are more than just the stereotype often portrayed in the media.

Through Dzaleka Connect, members of the community can build meaningful connections with one another and strengthen the larger Dzaleka community. Our decades of experience as refugees have given us a wealth of wisdom and wit that should be celebrated and shared with others. Dzaleka Connect is a space where we can support each other and be fully seen and recognized for who we are.

### Discover Opportunities

Dzaleka Connect provides a range of ways for members of the Dzaleka community to interact and connect with one another. Whether you are returning to the camp and want to meet some friendly locals during your stay, looking for valuable business knowledge, or want to help others succeed, Dzaleka Connect can help you make those important connections and seek out opportunities. With Dzaleka Connect, you can connect with like-minded individuals and build meaningful relationships that can benefit you both personally and professionally.
