Being a refugee is more than seeking asylum, it’s a sense of pride and belonging. We’re building on this strength by bringing refugees and diaspora all over the world together as one global community, sharing our knowledge, business opportunity, and connect with like-minded individuals.

Dzaleka had been a political prison before it was transformed into a refugee camp in response to a massive influx of refugees from Africa's Great Lakes region in 1994. Primary countries of origin represented in the camp include the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Prior to becoming a refugee camp, the Dzaleka facility had served as a political prison to around 6, 000 inmates. We have an opportunity to create Dzaleka's largest global community and shape the future of Malawi.

### Our Vision

Dzaleka is more than a refugee camp. The talent among the refugee community is endless – now we want to share those stories and celebrate the talent.
