Making cement covers for pit latrines was not something Kiza Sango, 27, thought she would end up doing to earn a living. She had grown up cultivating the fields next to her family home in South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2006, she fled to Malawi after armed rebel groups showed up at her house threatening to kill her and fisherman husband.  She and her family first lived in Luwani camp until they were transferred to Dzaleka in 2007.  She saw that many of the families had to dig and set up latrines behind their homes in the camp so she realized there was a need for   slabs to cover them.  She makes the slabs using cement, stones, sand and water. “They need to be strong so that no accidents happen,” says Sango.

She makes them in an open space just next to her mud house so that people in the camp will see that they are available for sale. The money she makes is used to supplement her food rations and purchase school supplies for her children.

 “The economy of Dzaleka is intertwined with the surrounding economies of the host community,” says Line Astrom, UNHCR’s Senior Regional Livelihoods Officer. “We need to better understand the socio-economic profile of the people, as well as the economic linkages and market opportunities to develop programmes that can make a difference and help people earn a living and support their families.”

Thus, recognizing that there are entrepreneurs in the refugee camp who, with some additional support, could eventually grow their businesses, UNHCR has embarked on a livelihoods survey in Dzaleka camp.  Once the results are tabulated, it will be used to develop a strategy to help refugees and surrounding communities on to the path to self-reliance.

“Dzaleka refugee camp has been around for more than 20 years. We know that there is donor fatigue in supporting programmes for refugees in the camps,” says Monique Ekoko, UNHCR’s Representative in Malawi. “This is apparent with the constant reduction in food rations due to lack of resources. We see the impact of the financial constraints on the resulting protection problems in the camp.  If we can develop a comprehensive livelihood programme that will decrease dependency on international aid and allow for families to be able to meet their needs independently, only then can we really help improve the lives of the refugees in Dzaleka.”
