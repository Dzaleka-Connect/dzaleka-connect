Josephine has lived in Dzaleka for ten years and only has herself to rely on within Dzaleka. Prior to receiving her sewing machine, Josephine was working on a friendâ€™s sewing machine which required her to pay them half of the profits she earned. Josephine is one step closer to financial independence within Dzaleka, and explained that she plans on teaching her neighbors how to tailor so they too can make money.
