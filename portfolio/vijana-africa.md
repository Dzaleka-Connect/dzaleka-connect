Vijana Africa is a community-based organization implemented in Dzaleka since February 2015. The organization was founded by refugees and asylum seekers who decided to be a part of the solution to their fellow refugeesâ€™ common challenges. Vijana Africa empowers women to self-reliance through rabbits, turkeys, and pigs farming. We also empower peer educators to raise awareness on community challenges such as sexual and reproductive health, peaceful coexistence between refugees and Malawians, Sexual and Gender-based violence, health issues, and many more. This community-based organization empowers the youth to filmmaking and computer basics. In addition, Vijana Africa mentors youth and promote leadership. Furthermore, Vijana Africa leads community services.
