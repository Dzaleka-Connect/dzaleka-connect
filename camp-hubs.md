Joining a local camp hub will provide community members with a way to connect with like-minded people near them within Dzaleka refugee camp and the diaspora.

### Local Camp Hubs

For those yearning to reconnect with Dzaleka, Camp hubs will offer the comfort of a local network with the prospects of a global one that can offer unique mentorship and investment opportunities as well as a bridge to give back.

For those in Dzaleka, Malawi, and diaspora around the world, camp hubs will be ‘on the ground’ intermediaries to help businesses and talent who are looking to trade, invest or find career opportunities in dzaleka refugee camp.
