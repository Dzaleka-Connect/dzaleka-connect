Welcome to the first edition of Dzaleka Connect, a monthly newsletter bringing you updates and information about the Dzaleka refugee camp in Malawi.

In this issue, we will be highlighting the achievements and successes of the refugees living in Dzaleka, as well as sharing updates on the various programs and initiatives that are working to improve the lives of those in the camp.

You will also have the opportunity to learn about the various organizations and volunteers who are working tirelessly to support the refugees in Dzaleka.

We hope that this newsletter will provide you with a deeper understanding and appreciation of the challenges and triumphs of the refugees living in Dzaleka, and will inspire you to get involved in supporting their efforts to rebuild their lives.

Stay tuned for future issues of Dzaleka Connect, where we will continue to bring you updates and stories from the camp. Thank you for your support!
