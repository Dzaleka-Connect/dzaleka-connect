Greetings,

We have a great update to share with you in this month's newsletter. Teachers at Newsletter #02 - Dzaleka Community Secondary School are now using digital learning technology to enhance their teaching and provide access to online learning materials. In December 2022, 20 teachers at the school received training on digital learning applications from the Ministry of Educationâ€™s Directorate for Digitalization and Mzuzu University computer scientists, with support from UNHCR. The school received 500 tablets and WiFi installation, funded by ECHO, to address the education challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and limited physical contact between teachers and students.
